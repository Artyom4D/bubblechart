# BubblechartJS

BubblechartJS is a JavaScript module for the comparative visualization of two dimensional data in Bubble Chart.

**Why write it in Coffeescript?**

I've never spent significant time with it, figured I'd give it a spin.

## Usage

## Process your own data

## Browser Support

This module relies heavily on the canvas support which is not support
in IE8 and older.

Most all other major browsers have support for `<canvas>`.

## Development

see [CONTRIBUTING.md]()
