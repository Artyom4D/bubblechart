# BubbleChart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jondavidjohn/bubblechart.png?branch=master,develop)](https://travis-ci.org/jondavidjohn/bubblechart)

BubbleChart is a JavaScript module for the comparative visualization of two dimensional data in bubble chart.

### Why write it in Coffeescript?

I've never spent significant time with it, figured I'd give it a spin.

## Usage

## Process your own data

## Browser Support

This module relies heavily on the canvas support which is not support
in IE8 and older.

Most all other major browsers have support for `<canvas>`.

## Development
