# BubbleChart

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jondavidjohn/bubblechart.png?branch=master,develop)](https://travis-ci.org/jondavidjohn/bubblechart)

BubbleChart is a JavaScript module for the comparative visualization of two dimensional data in bubble chart.

### Why write it in Coffeescript?

I've never worked with coffeescript, decided to give it a spin.

## Usage

## Process your own data

## Browser Support

This module relies heavily on `<canvas>` support, so no IE8 and older.

## Development

see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/jondavidjohn/bubblechart/edit/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
